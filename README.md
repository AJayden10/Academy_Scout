🌍 Project Overview

In the highly dynamic world of professional soccer, identifying and valuing young talent is crucial for clubs, scouts, and investors.
ScoutVest replicates this process in a simulated environment, enabling users to:

* Invest in promising young players.
* Forecast their future market value and development.
* Manage a virtual portfolio with risk and reward dynamics.
* Compete with other users on returns.

This project provides both an educational and entertainment platform, while showcasing the power of machine learning in sports finance.
