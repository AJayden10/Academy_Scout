SCOUTVEST: A REVOLUTIONARY INNOVATION IN THE WORLD OF SCOUTING IN PROFESSIONAL SCOUTING

Academy scout is an innovative platform that leverages machine learning to predict the future market value of young soccer players and provides a simulated investment environment for users to build and manage virtual portfolios. It brings together the worlds of sports analytics, finance, and artificial intelligence.

PROJECT OVERVIEW

In the highly dynamic world of professional soccer, identifying and valuing young talent is crucial for clubs and scouts. This project aims to replicate this process in a simulated environment, allowing users to "invest" in promising players based on data-driven predictions. ScoutVest combines extensive player data with advanced machine learning models to forecast future market values, player potential, and even injury risk, offering a unique perspective on player scouting and sports investment.
